# System Admin Automation Scripts

This repository serves as a centralized collection of automation scripts designed to streamline system administration tasks. It includes scripts for both Windows and Linux environments, organized into dedicated directories for easy access and management.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into two main folders: `windows` and `linux`, each containing subdirectories based on the scripting language or tool used.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to store and maintain a library of reusable automation scripts for system administration tasks, such as system monitoring, user management, file operations, and more. Contributions and improvements are welcome!

## Usage

1. Navigate to the appropriate folder (`windows` or `linux`) based on your operating system.
2. Select the subdirectory corresponding to your preferred scripting language or tool.
3. Review the script's comments or documentation (if available) for instructions on usage and dependencies.

## Prerequisites
